# Recoil Prototyping

I created this demo repo to explore using Recoil and Next.js together. This demo
is written twice: once using Next.js' new [App Router](https://nextjs.org/docs/app) paradigm, and again using the older [Pages Router](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages) paradigm.

## Getting Started

Start by installing dependencies:

```
npm i
```

Then, start the server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to explore
